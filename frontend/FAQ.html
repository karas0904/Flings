        <h2>Why Can’t I Comment?</h2>
        <p>
          To leave a comment, you’ll need to send a rose to that person first.
          Once the rose is sent, the comment box will unlock, letting you share
          your thoughts.

          video call, once both sides agree. In the Efforts section, you can see
          who has commented on or sent roses to you.

          remain viewable for five days, giving you a short window to see who’s
          shown interest in your profile.
